[BitTorrent Sync][1] will synchronize folders between any number of machines on either a local LAN, over the internet, or via both. It synchronizes without using a central server as everyone is a peer, it is a [peer-to-peer (P2P) network][2].

Folders can also be synchronized between machines using the open source OwnCloud or paid Dropbox but neither of them have a command line (headless) synch tool and neither of them will work on a LAN without a central server (they are not P2P). An added perk is that I now have a legitimate alibi if my ISP ever accuses me of pirating over the bittorrent network.

Benefits

  - Neither OwnCloud or Dropbox have headless sync clients (as of January 2016). I want to synchronize code between multiple Raspberry Pi computers and none of them are running a desktop GUI (this is intentional).
  - BitTorrent Sync can work on a local LAN with no internet and never needs a centralized server.
  - There is no limit on drive space.
  - Bit Torrent Sync should be faster.

###Download
```
#debian
wget https://download-cdn.getsync.com/stable/linux-x64/BitTorrent-Sync_x64.tar.gz
tar -zxvf BitTorrent-Sync_x64.tar.gz

#raspberry/arm
wget https://download-cdn.getsync.com/stable/linux-arm/BitTorrent-Sync_arm.tar.gz
```

###install and run by hand

```
#by default runs on localhost:8888, run as external ip (external meaning on my LAN)
./btsync  --webui.listen 192.168.1.200:8888

#kill daemon
pkill btsync
```

###Making btsync run at boot (raspbian)

Add the following to /etc/rc.local

```
/home/pi/btsynch/btsync --webui.listen 192.168.1.60:8888
```

###Making btsync run at boot (debian)

Way more complicated than Rasbian, but, following this perfect github gist:

https://gist.github.com/MendelGusmao/5398362

Once all of this is done you can interact with the btsync daemon:

```
sudo /etc/init.d/btsync start
sudo /etc/init.d/btsync stop
sudo /etc/init.d/btsync status
```

And configure your shares from a browser

```
http://192.168.1.200:8888
```

###Move btsync binary into place

```
sudo cp ./btsync /usr/bin/
```

###Modify btsync daemon script

See below for full script. Careful here, different from btsync binary but SAME name

```
sudo mv btsync /etc/init.d/
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/btsync
```

At this point I thought I could run the daemon without specifying a ~/.sync/config.json file but this does NOT work because the daemon will run inside /etc/init.d/ and try to create a .sync/ folder but it is not allowed to do that there.

###Make a ~/.sync folder in your user directory

This is my ~/.sync/config.json. Shared_folders will be specified in web ui. Changes from original gist include:

  - "device_name": "debian",
  - "storage_path": "/home/cudmore/.sync",
  - "listen": "192.168.1.200:8888",

```
{
  "device_name": "debian",
  "listening_port": 0,
  "storage_path": "/home/cudmore/.sync",
  "check_for_updates": true, 
  "use_upnp": true,
  "download_limit": 0,                       
  "upload_limit": 0, 
  "webui": {
    "listen": "192.168.1.200:8888",
    "login" : "admin",
    "password" : "password"
  },
  "shared_folders": []
}
```

This is my modified /etc/init.d/btsync daemon script. Well, not really modified except for changing BTSYNC_USER.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
### BEGIN INIT INFO

      echo "Starting BTSync for $btsuser"
      start-stop-daemon -b -o -c $btsuser -S -u $btsuser -x $DAEMON -- --config $config
    else
      echo "Couldn't start BTSync for $btsuser (no $config found)"

}

stop() {

    dbpid=`pgrep -fu $btsuser $DAEMON`
    if [ ! -z "$dbpid" ]; then
      echo "Stopping btsync for $btsuser"
      start-stop-daemon -o -c $btsuser -K -u $btsuser -x $DAEMON
    fi
  done
}

status() {

    dbpid=`pgrep -fu $btsuser $DAEMON`
    if [ -z "$dbpid" ]; then
      echo "btsync for USER $btsuser: not running."
    else
      echo "btsync for USER $btsuser: running (pid $dbpid)"
    fi
  done
}
