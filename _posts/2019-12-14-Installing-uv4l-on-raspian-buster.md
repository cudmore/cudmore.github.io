## Install uv4l on Buster

This is a recipe to install uv4l on a Raspberry 4 computer with Raspian Buster. Not much has changed since Raspian Stretch. As this recipe is followed, please pay attention to the details!

After this install, run `uv4l` as follows:

```
uv4l --driver raspicam --auto-video_nr --encoding h264 --enable-server on
```

And then view the stream in a browser with (pleae note your IP address might be different)

```
http://192.168.1.9:8080/stream
```

Please see my video controller software [PiE](http://blog.cudmore.io/pie-doc/), it uses uv4l out of the box on both Stretch and Buster.

### Recipe

(1)

Add the uv4l key to your apt-key package manager.

```
curl http://www.linux-projects.org/listing/uv4l_repo/lpkey.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```

**Note:** I am not sure what the difference is between `lpkey.asc` and `lrkey.asc`? My installations on Stretch were using the wrong key! I was using `lrkey.asc` while I should have been using the `p` variant `lpkey.asc`. Not sure why this worked on Stretch but it did. For Buster, you **must** use `lpkey.asc`.

(2) Add the following line to `/etc/apt/sources.list` using `sudo pico /etc/apt/sources.list`

```
deb http://www.linux-projects.org/listing/uv4l_repo/raspbian/stretch stretch main
```

(3) Update apt-get and install with apt-get using

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install uv4l uv4l-server uv4l-raspicam
```

**Important:** I was previously using `sudo apt-get -qq --allow-unauthenticated install uv4l uv4l-server uv4l-raspicam` and with Buster, the use of `--allow-unauthenticated` seems to break the install?

(4) Run the uv4l server with

```
uv4l --driver raspicam --auto-video_nr --encoding h264 --width 1280 --height 720 --enable-server on
```

And then view the stream in a browser with (pleae note your IP address might be different)

```
http://192.168.1.9:8080/stream
```

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes you get multiple `/dev/video0`, `/dev/video1`, `/dev/video10` excetera devices. Feal free to remove the with `sudo rm /vev/video*` and then maybe restart with `sudo reboot`.

### Details:

`sudo apt-get update` returns
