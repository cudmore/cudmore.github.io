This is a video server running on a raspberry Pi Linux computer. It is designed to monitor a video camera pointing at your animal.

It allows you to:

1 - Arm - Automatically record videos whenever you start acquisition in ScanImage  
2 - Record - Record a one time video  
3 - Stream - Stream the video to your web browser so you can see a live feed of your animal  

It will only do one of these at a time. You cannot do any combination  of (1), (2) or (3) at the same time.
