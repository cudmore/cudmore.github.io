I am venturing out to comment on science rather than how to make science stuff.

Excellent NY Times article

http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/opinion/sunday/do-you-believe-in-god-or-is-that-a-software-glitch.html?_r=0

About bad statistics in fMRI data published in PNAS here

http://www.pnas.org/content/113/28/7900.full#ref-15

They slam a bunch of fMRI software for producing about 70% false-positives when it should be 5%. Bottom line is you need to use non-parametric tests to remove colored noise (my term) or correlation in spatially localized voxels in fMRI. Well, no shit sherlock. What were you thinking?

Then, among the software that they slam is

http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/

WTF? This is open-source software coming out of UCL. Can they really be that bad? I don't know.

Is this like a case where you are allowed to write bad sentences in a word processor but would never blaim the programmer who made the word-processor.

really nice post on how software engineers (like me) can fail

http://yosefk.com/blog/why-bad-scientific-code-beats-code-following-best-practices.html

I guess in response to this

http://techblog.bozho.net/the-astonishingly-low-quality-of-scientific-code/

Which in itself is pretty good. The problem that biology research does not pay programmers so has all this sfotware that is oe big hack.

Pretty amazing collection of scientific pdf's and almost completely illegal

https://scihub22266oqcxt.onion.link/

This was written up in tech crunch (tc)

https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/29/sci-hub-is-providing-science-publishers-with-their-napster-moment/

and freaking published in science

http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/whos-downloading-pirated-papers-everyone

Elsevier is after sci-hub creator 

here she is

http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/alexandra-elbakyan-founded-sci-hub-thwart-journal-paywalls

unless she keeps spinning the good of this (as she is doing incredibly) she will go to jail
