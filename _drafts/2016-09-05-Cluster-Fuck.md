About bad statistics in fMRI data published in PNAS here

http://www.pnas.org/content/113/28/7900.full#ref-15

They slam a bunch of fMRI software for producing about 70% false-positives when it should be 5%. Bottom line is you need to use non-parametric tests to remove colored noise (my term) or correlation in spatially localized voxels in fMRI. Well, no shit sherlock. What were you thinking?

Then, among the software that they slam is

WTF? This is open-source software coming out of UCL. Can they really be that bad? I don't know.

Is this like a case where you are allowed to write bad sentences in a word processor but would never blaim the programmer who made the word-processor.
