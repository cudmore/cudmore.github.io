I am venturing out to comment on science rather than how to make science stuff.

Excellent NY Times article

About bad statistics in fMRI data published in PNAS here

http://www.pnas.org/content/113/28/7900.full#ref-15

They slam a bunch of fMRI software for producing about 70% false-positives when it should be 5%. Bottom line is you need to use non-parametric tests to remove colored noise (my term) or correlation in spatially localized voxels in fMRI. Well, no shit sherlock. What were you thinking?

Then, among the software that they slam is

WTF? This is open-source software coming out of UCL. Can they really be that bad? I don't know.

Is this like a case where you are allowed to write bad sentences in a word processor but would never blaim the programmer who made the word-processor.


# part two

really nice post on how software engineers (like me) can fail

I guess in response to this

Which in itself is pretty good. The problem that biology research does not pay programmers so has all this sfotware that is oe big hack.
