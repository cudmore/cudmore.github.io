# Robert Cudmore's blog 

## Introduction

This is the Jekyll source code and post data for my blog, the layout is auto generated using Jekyll and a theme based on Hyde which is based on Poole.

If you are interested, you can use some of the formatting I have employed.

- I generate a tag list and page by using the [tags.html](https://github.com/cudmore/cudmore.github.io/blob/master/tags.html) file. This requires each post to have some yaml front matter:

~~~
	---
	layout: post
	title: "Use OpenCV to acquire video"
	category: post
	date: 2015-03-07 22:01:06
	tags:
	- video  
	- acquisition  
	- opencv  
	---  
~~~

- I generate an archive page with [archive.md](https://github.com/cudmore/cudmore.github.io/blob/master/archive.md).
