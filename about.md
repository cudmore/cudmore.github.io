This is a blog written by [Robert Cudmore][1].

It is a place where I put things so I have access to them from anywhere I have an internet connection.

This blog is written in [redcarpet][2] [markdown][3] using [Jekyll][4] and is hosted on my [Github][5] site.

I started this blog on February 7, 2015 to replace my previous WordPress [blog][6].
